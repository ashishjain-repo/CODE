<h2>ASH</h2>
<p>Hello all. Let me introduce myself. I am from New Delhi, India. It is always hot and humid, but it is a cool place to live but not cool literally.</p>
<p>I have been member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 9 months now. The things I love about the Church, Jesus Christ, Temple Trips, Lovely & Kind people, and Sacrament Meetings.</p>
<p>Currently, I am Majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Physics. I am pursuing this field so some day I can contribute in the field of Computer Science. I love programming and Mathematics a lot. In my free time I like to code preferably in PHP and I like to make cool web-applications from scratch.</p>
